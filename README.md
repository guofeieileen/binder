Identifying Protein-Protein Interface via a Novel Multi-Scale Local Sequence and Structural Representation

We obtain the local information on protein-protein interface, through multi-scale local average block and hexagon structure construction. 
Given a pair of proteins, we use a trained support vector regression (SVR) model to select best configurations.
